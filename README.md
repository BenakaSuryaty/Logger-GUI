# Logger-GUI
A simple Tkinter GUI for tracking time spent in a medical scanning machine.

- The "timer" folder contains the py script for running the GUI as well as various icon files.
- The "timer_disp" folder contains the Arduino firmware to burn on any supported embedded device in order to communicate serially with the computer and trigger the relay upon completion/end of countdown to shutdown the machine.
